<h3>Summary of Project</h3>

For our project we would like to create a model that predicts the success rate of a box office movie such as a fail, hit, or superhit. The premise of this project stemmed from answering the question of whether we could predict the success of the movie only knowing data about a movie prior to  release.<br>

While answering this question, a few question we first asked ourselves were:
* What parameters best predict the success rate of the movie (genre, director, budget, etc.)?
* Which cast or actor best predict the movies?
* Can we look at the genre of the movie to help classify?
* Does the time the movie is released throughout the year influence how the movie does?
